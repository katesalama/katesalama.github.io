Dr. Salama (formerly Lieb) is the first author on this [study](/perinatal_anxiety_screening.pdf) published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM. It assessed the utility of adding perinatal anxiety screening to existing depression screening and found that screening for perinatal anxiety may increase referrals to mental health professionals and may be particularly useful in populations with a history of mental health diagnoses or substance abuse.
