<br><br>In addition to providing care in Colorado, she is available to see patients who reside in New York and Massachusetts via telehealth.
<br><br>If you are interested in care, she will first have a free 10 minute phone consultation with you to discuss why you are seeking care and give a brief overview of her services. If it seems like a good fit, we can then schedule your initial appointment. 
<br><br>The first session is a 75 minute comprehensive consultation to discuss your history, preliminary diagnosis, and together develop a treatment plan.
<br><br>Routine follow up appointments (25 minutes) can include medication management, education, collaboration with other members of your care team, and brief psychotherapy. 
<br><br>Please note that Dr. Salama is out of network with all insurance carriers.  You are responsible for service fees and may submit a statement to your insurance company for reimbursement in accordance with your plan. She is happy to provide an invoice to you for submission to insurance for reimbursement.
